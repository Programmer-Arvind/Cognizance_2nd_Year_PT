# Story Driven - Decrypting the Cipher Code solution

## Algorithm used
- Step 1: Decode the morse code to find the secret key - https://morsedecoder.com - The key was `S3CR3TK3Y@123456`
- Step 2: Trying out various encryption techniques like AES, DES, We found the right technique is AES.
- Step 3: Decrypting using AES 128 CBC, we get the password to the file as `algorithmissafe`
- Step 4: Unlocking the given pdf with the found password reveals the secret code written in the file

## The password used to unlock the pdf is
`algorithmissafe`

## Secret code present in Cyber Threat Advanced Machine Learning Algorithm PDF is
CogML24@2024
